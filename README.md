In this project, our goal is to design a fuzzy expert system to detect whether a person has heart disease. ￼￼￼

The inputs to this problem include the following:
Chest pain, blood pressure, ECG1, maximum heart rate, sports activity, Old peak, amount of thallium, gender, age.

Finally, the outcome determines whether or not a person has heart disease.
